/**
 * Ownership is the process memory management and
 * allocation between the stack and the heap
 * It frees memory (drop function) once the variables are out of scope
 * 
 * The stack stores values as last in, first out
 * 
 * The heap allocates a certain space in memory to be used and returns a pointer
 * Because the pointer to the heap is a known fixed size, it can be stored in the stack
 * 
 * Ownership rules
 * - each value has an owner
 * - there can only be one owner at a time
 * - when the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped
 * 
 * cloning a String type variable will create a deep copy on the heap
 * 
 * it not required to use clone() for integers because they are stored on the stack
 * No difference between deep and shallow copying when variable is created on the stack
 * 
 * Scalar variables can have a Copy trait
 * */
